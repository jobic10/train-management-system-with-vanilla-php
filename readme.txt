Hi, I am Owonubi Job Sunday.
Howdy!


Be sure to have XAMPP installed...
From "My Computer" on your Computer :-),
Go to your local disk (Drive C)
Go to Xampp
Go to htdocs

Now, inside HTDOCS, create a new folder and name it 'train' without quotes.
The folder name must be train

Now, be sure you have Apache and MySQL running on 
Open your browser, 
type
localhost/phpmyadmin

This will load up for you the DBMS.
Click on database,
you'd see a page where you'd be asked to type database name for you to be able to create a new database.
the database name also must be 'train' without quotes.
Once the database named train is created, click on import
click on browse, locate your project, there is train.sql file inside it; select it and proceed.
You should see a button that reads 'Go' when you scroll down.

I no even suppose explain this to you lol.... you be boss.
